## 1. Challenge Information
> I made a simple webpage that checks whether the flag is correct... Wait, where are the flag-checking functions?
> 

## 2. Exploitation
1. Inspect the Page:

    - Upon inspecting the webpage, there’s an empty or seemingly empty JavaScript block.
    - There’s also a link to an X post: [Link](https://x.com/aemkei/status/1843756978147078286). This post introduces the concept of hiding JavaScript code using the Hangul Filler character (`\\u3164`).
2. Invisible Code Concept:
    - The JavaScript code relies on the `\\u3164` character, which is an invisible Hangul Filler character, to hide the flag-checking logic.
    - The `with` block is used to access properties formed by sequences of `\\u3164`. The length of these sequences represents the binary value of the ASCII character.
3. Proxy and Property Access:
    - A `Proxy` object is used to intercept the property accesses within the `with` block.
    - Every time a property is accessed, the `Proxy` counts the number of `\\u3164` characters in the property name. The number of characters corresponds to an ASCII value:
        - For example, if there are 65 `\\u3164` characters in a sequence, it represents 65 (in decimal) or `01000001` in binary, which corresponds to the letter "A" in ASCII.
4. Building JavaScript Code:
    - The `Proxy` continues to collect these binary values with each property access. These bits are gathered until a complete JavaScript command is formed.
    - Once enough data is collected, the Proxy evaluates the constructed command using `eval()`.
5. Decoding the Data:

    - To view the constructed JavaScript code in the console, type the following:
        
        ```jsx
        f += String.fromCharCode(p[0] << 4 | p[1]);
        ```
